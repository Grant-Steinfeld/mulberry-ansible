# Instructions to use Ansible-playbook

## Preparing the workstation/laptop
 Ansible is a software you will run from your laptop/workstation.
Ansible runs locally there.  It uses ssh to connect to one/more CentOS servers
in order to run commands there remotely.  

NOTE no ansible software is installed on the server, only on your local workstation/laptop

##To set Ansible up depends on your operating system

###Mac OSx
brew install ansible
